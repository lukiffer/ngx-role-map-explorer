This is a quick-and-dirty rendering tool to plan a functional org chart in the
[Spotify model](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify). It uses a single JSON file as data store which
uses the below-described schema.

![Example Map Rendering](.docs/example.png)

You can click on most entities to apply filters to that entity (Chapter, Tribe, Squad, Member, etc.) or use the filters
in the top toolbar to apply additional filters.

## Usage

To run the application, run `npm run start` from the project root.

## Map Data

The entire map schema is defined in `.map.schema.json` in the repository root.

A map contains two keys in the root object:

```json
{
  "chapters": [],
  "tribes": []
}
```

### Chapters

Chapters consist of a name (to which "Chapter" is suffixed), the name of a leader, and a hex RGB color (without the `#`
prefix):

```json
{
  "name": "Product",
  "leader": "Beth Smith",
  "color": "7700FF"
}
```

### Tribes and Squads

Tribes have a name, and a nested array of Squads, which in turn have a name, type, and nested array of members.

```json
{
  "name": "Alpha",
  "squads": [{
    "name": "Example",
    "type": "Experience",
    "members": [{
      "name": "Morty Smith",
      "role": "Engineering Lead",
      "chapter": "Engineering"
    }]
  }]
}
```

Members have a name, role, and chapter assignment. The chapter assignment must match the name of a Chapter in order to
be correctly rendered.

```json
{
  "name": "Jerry Smith",
  "role": "Support Agent",
  "chapter": "Support"
}
```

There are additional optional properties on the member object which affect rendering:

- `contractor` (`boolean`) â€“ filterable, denotes whether or not the member is a contractor
- `vacant` (`boolean`) - filterable, denotes whether the role is currently vacant or filled
- `future` (`boolean`) - denotes whether or not the role is currently being serviced by that member
